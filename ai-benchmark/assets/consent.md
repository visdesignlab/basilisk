## Title of Research Study: Investigating Data Visualization Literacy
## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks or discomfort that you may experience as a result of your participation. This form presents information about the study so that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly common in everyday life. The purpose of this study is to learn more about how people interpret and understand visualizations, especially correlation values.

## Tasks
The study contains 3 sets of tasks, shown to you in a random order. One set will ask you to critique data visualizations which are presented. Another set will ask you to sketch data visualizations on your device, given a small amount of data. The last task will ask you quiz-like multiple choice questions which can be answered from a presented data visualization. It will take approximately 40-50 minutes to finish this study. For many of these tasks we will request that you think-aloud while completing the task, and we will record and save your audio.

## Risks to study participants
Each participant in this study is assigned a random ID for analyses. As such, your participation will remain anonymous and your responses will not be used to identify you.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
There may be no direct benefits to participants. The possible benefits for participants include exposure to interesting data visualization, along with helping inform the development of future visualization literacy measurements. 

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study investigators, the sponsor or its designee and, under certain circumstances, the University of Utah Institutional Review Board (U of U IRB) will be able to inspect and have access to this data. Any publication or presentation of the data will not identify you.

## Cost/Payment
Please check the Prolific description.

The project investigators retain the right to cancel or postpone the experimental procedures at any time they see fit.

## Future Use of Private Information
As part of this study, we would like to keep information collected in during this project so that researchers may use it in the future in other research projects. When we use the term "data repository", it refers to the storage of the information that is collected.

## What will be kept?
We would like to keep recorded audio while you take this study, as well as interaction log data.

## What will my information be used for?
Information collected about you may be used for future research about data visualization to help us learn more, and may be presented in research papers or presentations.

## Who will keep my information?
Your information will be kept by Dr. Alexander Lex who manages the data repository at the University of Utah.
## Do I have to allow my information to be saved for future research?
If you do not want your information to be saved for future research, you should not participate in this study.
## Will my information be personally identifiable?
The information kept from you will not have your name or other personal information linked to it. Your de-identified information may be shared with researchers at the University of Utah and at other institutions without additional informed consent from you or your legally authorized representative. The only information we will keep is information like your age.

## What if I want to withdraw my information from the data repository?
If you contact us via the platform which you were recruited from, you may request to have your data removed at any time, at which point we will delete your audio recordings.

## Will my information be used for commercial profit?
Information obtained from you in this research may help in the development of a commercial product by University of Utah or its research partners. There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this occur.

## Will future results or findings be given to me?
Because your information cannot be linked back to you, we will not share the results from future studies with you.
